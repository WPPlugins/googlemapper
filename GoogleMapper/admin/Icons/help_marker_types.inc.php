A Marker Type is made up of a Title, and two icons (ideally one small and one large). The point of having large and small icons is that when the map is zoomed out, large icons for locations close to each other tend to clump. GoogleMapper's maps have a field, 'Switch Zoom Level', that tells the map at what zoom level it should switch to larger icons. The effect is that looking at, for example, a region of several states, small icons will fill the map, but zooming in closer to a view of a county or town would use the larger icons. If no Large Icon has been defined, the mapper will simply use the small icon as a default.
